📊 Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

End-to-End Data Analytics Project using Python, SQL, and Power BI

📁 Project Overview

This project presents a complete data analytics workflow to analyze customer shopping behavior across different demographics, product categories, and purchase patterns. Using Python for EDA, SQL for deeper querying, and Power BI for dashboard visualization, the project delivers actionable insights that can support business decisions, marketing strategies, and customer segmentation.

🎯 Problem Statement

Retail businesses often struggle to understand what drives customer purchases, which customer groups spend more, and how product categories perform.
This project aims to solve this by analyzing customer data to uncover behavioral patterns, spending habits, and performance indicators.


✔️ Project Objectives

- Identify customer segments based on demographics and past purchases.

- Compare revenue patterns across gender, age groups, subscription status, and shipping types.

- Evaluate product performance and rating trends.

- Study discount usage and purchasing behavior.

- Build a dashboard that allows decision-makers to interact with insights.

- Provide end-to-end documentation of the full analytics pipeline.

🔍 Key Insights (SQL + Python)-


- Based on SQL analysis: 

1.Customer_shopping_Behavior_Analysis

2.Male customers generated more total revenue than female customers.

3.Customers using discounts but still spending above the average amount were identified.

4.Express shipping customers had slightly higher average spend (60.48) vs Standard (58.46).

5.Subscribed customers showed higher spending and revenue contribution.

6.Top 5 products with the highest discount usage were identified.

7.Customers segmented into New, Returning, Loyal using previous purchases.

8.Top 3 products per category extracted using window functions.

9.Age groups contributing most revenue were identified.
